Absolutely. If you want to move **beyond Top-N-per-Group**, there are several other **classic SQL interview patterns** you should recognize.

## Classic SQL Problem Patterns

### 1. 🔥 Top-N per Group

> Find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.

```text
PARTITION BY dept_id
→ ORDER BY salary DESC
→ DENSE_RANK()
→ rank <= 3
```

---

### 2. 🔥 Above Average

> Find employees earning more than the overall average salary.

```text
Employee salary
      ↓
Compare with AVG(all employees)
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employee
);
```

---

### 3. 🔥 Group Above Threshold

> Find departments whose average salary is greater than 70,000.

```text
GROUP BY dept_id
      ↓
AVG(salary)
      ↓
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000
```

```sql
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;
```

---

### 4. 🔥 Second Highest

> Find the second-highest salary.

Classic approaches:

```text
MAX(salary)
→ exclude MAX
→ MAX again
```

or:

```text
DENSE_RANK()
→ rank = 2
```

---

### 5. 🔥 Duplicate Detection

> Find employees having duplicate salaries.

```sql
SELECT salary, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY salary
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

Pattern:

```text
GROUP BY
→ COUNT
→ HAVING COUNT > 1
```

---

### 6. 🔥 Find Rows Having Duplicates

Different from merely finding the duplicate value.

> Find all employees whose salary is duplicated.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary IN (
    SELECT salary
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY salary
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

Pattern:

```text
Find duplicate values
       ↓
Use them to filter original rows
```

---

### 7. 🔥 Missing Data / Anti-Join

> Find departments that have no employees.

If you have a `department` table:

```sql
SELECT d.*
FROM department d
LEFT JOIN employee e
    ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL;
```

Pattern:

```text
LEFT JOIN
→ NULL check
→ missing relationship
```

Very common interview pattern.

---

### 8. 🔥 Self Join / Hierarchical Data

Your table has:

```text
employee_id
manager_id
```

So:

> Find each employee along with their manager's name.

```sql
SELECT
    e.employee_name AS employee,
    m.employee_name AS manager
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN employee m
    ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

Pattern:

```text
Same table
   ↓
Join table to itself
   ↓
Self JOIN
```

---

### 9. 🔥 Running Total

> Calculate cumulative salary based on employee ID.

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY employee_id
    ) AS running_salary
FROM employee;
```

Pattern:

```text
Window function
→ ORDER BY
→ aggregate OVER()
```

---

### 10. 🔥 Previous / Next Row

> Compare an employee's salary with the previous employee's salary.

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY employee_id
    ) AS previous_salary
FROM employee;
```

Pattern:

```text
LAG()   → previous row
LEAD()  → next row
```

---

### 11. 🔥 Find Employees Above Department Average

This is a **very classic combination**:

> Find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their own department.

```text
Employee
   ↓
Their department
   ↓
Department AVG
   ↓
Compare employee salary
```

Using a window function:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        e.*,
        AVG(salary) OVER (
            PARTITION BY dept_id
        ) AS dept_avg
    FROM employee e
) x
WHERE salary > dept_avg;
```

---

### 12. 🔥 Greatest-N-per-Group — Without Window Functions

> Find highest-paid employee per department.

Classic older-SQL approach:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
      AND e2.salary > e.salary
);
```

Pattern:

```text
"No better row exists"
→ current row is the best
```

---

## 🧠 The patterns I'd prioritize for interviews

For your SQL practice, I'd organize questions into these **10 buckets**:

```text
1. GROUP BY + HAVING
   → Group filtering

2. Subquery
   → Compare against calculated value

3. Top-N per Group
   → ROW_NUMBER / RANK / DENSE_RANK

4. Duplicate Detection
   → GROUP BY + COUNT

5. Self JOIN
   → Employee / Manager

6. Anti JOIN
   → Find missing records

7. Window Aggregates
   → Running total / department average

8. LAG / LEAD
   → Previous / next row

9. Second / Nth Highest
   → Ranking / subquery

10. EXISTS / NOT EXISTS
   → Relationship / "doesn't exist"
```

**Top-N-per-Group is just one classic pattern.** The real interview skill is recognizing **which pattern the question is describing** before writing the SQL.
